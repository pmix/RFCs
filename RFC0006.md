# RFC0006

## Abstract
This is a major modification of the PMIx code base to support dynamic plugins, primarily enabling cross-version communication compatibility. The new plugin manager is also expected to be used for future extensions including data storage and messaging subsystems.

## Description
Some quick notes:

* Current implementation assumes that all PMIx server daemons are using a common version, and therefore are using the same bfrops plugin. This may be relaxed once an internal mechanism for cross-node communication is provided.

* We allow that any client may be using a different library version both from the local PMIx server and its own peers. For performance, we default to the expectation that all peers will use the same library version, and modify from that default when a client reports a different scenario.
