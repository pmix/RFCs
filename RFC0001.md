# RFC0001
Amended and extended by [RFC0010: Extension of Tool Interaction Support](https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0010.md)

## Title
Provide a mechanism by which tools can interact with a local PMIx server that has opted to accept such connections.

## Abstract
Tools may want to connect to PMIx to query the resource manager for information such as job status and system state, or to request that jobs be spawned or an allocation be created. This RFC proposes a method by which a PMIx server can declare itself available for such services, and a tool can rendezvous with that server to initiate the interaction.

_NOTE: The host resource manager is responsible for validating the tool's connection request, and ensuring proper authorizations for tool requests._

## Description
The primary purpose of PMIx is to provide a mechanism by which applications can interact with their host resource manager (RM). However, there are times when non-application processes (e.g., command-line tools) may also wish to communicate with the host RM. Historically, such tools were custom-written for each specific RM due to the customized and/or proprietary nature of the RM interfaces.

The advent of PMIx offers the possibility for creating portable tools capable of querying multiple RMs without modification. Possible use-cases include:

* querying the status of scheduling queues, estimated allocation time for various resource options

* job submission and allocation requests

* querying of job status for executing applications

The key to supporting such uses lies in providing a mechanism by which a tool can connect to a local PMIx server. Application processes are able to connect because their local RM daemon provides them with the necessary contact information upon execution. A command-line tool, however, isn't spawned by the RM daemon, and therefore lacks the information required for rendezvous with the PMIx server.

This RFC involves two extensions to the code base:

* **Extended by [RFC0010](https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0010.md)** addition of a rendezvous mechanism for tools to connect to a local PMIx server. The host RM can direct the local PMIx server to accept tool connections by providing the _PMIX\_SERVER\_TOOL\_SUPPORT_ info key to the PMIx_server_init function call. This directs the PMIx server to establish a separate Unix domain socket for tool connections, using a well-known file name of pmix.<hostname>.tool.<pid> placed in the  temporary directory location as specified by either the TEMPDIR, TEMP, and TMP environmental variables.

  When a tool calls _PMIx\_tool\_init_, the PMIx library will search the temporary directory for files matching the defined name template. If only one file is found, then the tool uses that as the rendezvous point and initiates the connection. If multiple files are found, either due to the presence of multiple PMIx servers or stale files, then the PMIx library will return an error as it cannot determine which server to use without further input from the caller. Callers can stipulate the server by providing the pid of the target server using the _PMIX\_SERVER\_PIDINFO_ key in the call to init.

  Once the connection has been made, the tool has access to all the PMIx client interfaces, subject to constraints imposed by the host RM.

* **Amended by [RFC0010](https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0010.md)** addition of a _PMIx\_Query\_info_ API by which the caller can request system-level information from the host RM. Note that the host RM itself may not have all the information being requested - e.g., the fabric manager may need to be consulted regarding fabric-related requests. However, all requests for information are relayed to the host RM for handling.

  The query API is not expected to be used for retrieving information that was published via either the _PMIx\_Put_ or _PMIx\_Publish_ functions. Instead, the new API targets information that relates to the overall system vs any specific allocation or application. Examples include:

  * _PMIX\_QUERY\_NAMESPACES_ - retrieve a comma-delimited list of nspaces for all currently executing jobs
  * _PMIX\_QUERY\_JOB\_STATUS_ - retrieve the status of the specified currently executing job
  * _PMIX\_QUERY\_QUEUE\_LIST - retrieve a comma-delimited list of scheduler queues
  * _PMIX\_QUERY\_QUEUE\_STATUS_ - retrieve the status of the specified scheduler queue

  Requests for specified information require the use of the _pmix\_info\_array\_t_ entry in the _pmix\_info\_t_ object. For example, a request to retrieve the status of a specified list of executing jobs might look like the following:

  ```c
  pmix_info_t info, *array;
  size_t n;

  PMIX_INFO_CONSTRUCT(&info);
  (void)strncpy(info.key, PMIX_QUERY_JOB_STATUS, PMIX_MAX_KEYLEN);
  info.value.type = PMIX_INFO_ARRAY;
  // now create the array we will use to pass the jobs we want to know about
  array = &info.value.data.array;
  PMIX_INFO_CREATE(array->array, 3);
  array->size = 3;
  for (n=0; n < 3; n++) {
      (void)strncpy(array->array[n].key, <nspace-of-job>, PMIX_MAX_KEYLEN);
  }
  PMIx_Query_info(&info, 1);
  ```
  
  The PMIx server will pass this request to the host RM, which will parse the input and provide the status of each given job in the corresponding _pmix\_value\_t_ field in that job's array element.

NOTE: The host resource manager is responsible for validating the tool's connection request, and ensuring proper authorizations for tool requests. The PMIx server library will provide the host RM with the effective UID and GID of the tool process as reported by standard system queries of the socket (e.g., using getpeereid).


## Protoype Implementation
The PMIx library implementation is covered in the [Tool Connection to PMIx Server](https://github.com/pmix/master/pull/68) pull request. The prototype has been tested against Open MPI as referenced in the [Add support for PMIx tool connections and queries](https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/pull/1801) pull request.
