# RFC0003

## Title
Modification of the PMIx\_Connect and PMIx\_Disconnect functions to support new proposed programming model behavior

## Abstract
New programming models, and changes to existing programming models, are emerging that desire the ability to more flexibly connect and disconnect processes from groups. This proposed change will:

* modify two existing client-side APIs (PMIx\_Connect and PMIx\_Disconnect)
  plus their corresponding resource manager interfaces

* add two new info keys (PMIX\_CONNECT\_COLLECTIVE and PMIX\_CONNECT\_EVENT)
* 
* modify the PMIx server library to track the nspaces of connected groups

## Description
A detailed description of the proposed change. The length and degree of detail should be commensurate with the magnitude of the change. This is not intended to be burdensome, nor are there any awards for verbosity - but clear communication will avoid repeated requests for alterations. The description should indicate what is being modified, both functionally and by file name.

## Protoype Implementation
Provide a reference link to the accompanying Pull Request (PR) against the PMIx master repository. If the prototype implementation has been tested against an appropriately modified resource manager and/or client program, then references to those prototypes should be provided. Note that approval of any RFC will be far more likely to happen if such validation has been performed!
