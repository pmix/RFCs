# RFC007

## Title
Collective communications

## Abstract
There are two types of collective operations performed within PMIx: (a) reliable broadcast (_bcast_) of events, and (b) collection of arbitrary amounts of data from all participants (_allgatherv_). The latter is also used to provide a _barrier_ operation by collecting zero-byte data contributions. This proposal adds a framework capable of supporting multiple collective implementations thru a common abstraction interface.

## Description
A detailed description of the proposed change. The length and degree of detail should be commensurate with the magnitude of the change. This is not intended to be burdensome, nor are there any awards for verbosity - but clear communication will avoid repeated requests for alterations. The description should indicate what is being modified, both functionally and by file name.

## Protoype Implementation
Provide a reference link to the accompanying Pull Request (PR) against the PMIx master repository. If the prototype implementation has been tested against an appropriately modified resource manager and/or client program, then references to those prototypes should be provided. Note that approval of any RFC will be far more likely to happen if such validation has been performed!
